# Worldmart React Native App #


Capstone React Native project from online course.


Note: App requires a mock server back-end addon to run. The mock server back-end must be configured to your server machine's IPv4 address. These settings are located in the server's back-end config/development.json file. Run ipconfig to see what your server machine's IP address is.
