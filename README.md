# Worldmart React Native App #


Capstone React Native project from online course.


Note: App requires a mock server back-end addon to run. The mock server back-end must be configured to your server machine's IPv4 address. These settings are located in the server's back-end config/development.json file. Run ipconfig to see what your server machine's IP address is.


This React Native App uses the following dependencies: [React Native Docs (expo)](https://reactnative.dev/), [Expo API docs (GestureHandler)](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/), [Expo API Image Picker](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v40.0.0/sdk/imagepicker/), [Expo API Location](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v40.0.0/sdk/location/), [Expo Permissions](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v40.0.0/sdk/permissions/) [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), [MaterialCommunityIcons](https://icons.expo.fyi/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Tailwind-RN](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn#readme), [React-Native-Hooks](https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks), [Formik](https://formik.org/), [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), 

NOTE: Use command `npx create-tailwind-rn` every time you update your tailwind.config.js file. This command is needed to create the styles.json file during development. The styles.json is un-tracked ONLY when purge is enabled.
