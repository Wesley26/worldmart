# Worldmart React Native App #


This React Native App uses the following dependencies: [React Native Docs (expo)](https://reactnative.dev/), [Expo API docs (GestureHandler)](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Tailwind-RN](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn#readme), [React-Native-Hooks](https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks), [Formik](https://formik.org/), [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), 

NOTE: Use command `npx create-tailwind-rn` every time you update your tailwind.config.js file. This command is needed to create the styles.json file during development. The styles.json is un-tracked ONLY when purge is enabled.
